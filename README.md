# Review and Prospect of Digital Currency Capital Market
2018 was a year from fanaticism to rationality in the digital asset market, though the total number of digital assets was still growing, according to Coin Market Cap data, there are more than 2,000 digital assets in the world, which is about 45% higher than the end of 2017. However, the total market value of digital assets shrank sharply in 2018, and the volume of market transactions declined sharply. The weak market performance and confidence are also gradually transmitted to the primary market, and the crowdsourcing of digital assets and block chain projects will gradually drop to freezing point in 2018.

## 1.Digital currency capital market is facing a cold winter in 2018.
## 1.1. Market value and trading volume have declined sharply
In 2017, the digital asset market experienced an explosive growth, with its total market value soaring from $17.74 billion at the beginning of the year to $559.76 billion at the end of the year, a 30-fold increase that exceeded the return of any other asset class. However, after entering 2018, the digital asset market has turned around and prices have retreated dramatically. As of December 31, the market value is about 130 billion US dollars, and the overall market has shrunk by more than 80% this year.

In addition to February, April and July, the market value of digital assets continued to decline for the rest of 2018. In April this year, stimulated by several DPO consensus projects (such as EOS and TRX) competing to open super-node elections, the digital asset market ushered in a wave of small markets, and some digital asset prices rose rapidly. In July, driven by a series of hot spots in DAPP applications dominated by transaction mining and FOMO3D, the market also showed a distinct small market.

In 2018, the 24H trading volume of global digital assets peaked on January 4 ($70.04 billion). As the market for digital assets cooled, it reached a 18-year low of $8.78 billion on October 27, down 87.6% from its peak. 

## 1.2. The depression of Primary Market Financing
Emerging digital assets broke out in 2017, and related financing amount increased rapidly, reaching a new high in 2018. According to ICO Rating data, there are 2243 projects in the primary market in 2018, totaling more than 11.6 billion US dollars. The number of projects increased by 200% and the amount of financing increased by 94%.

However, the amount of crowdsourcing for digital assets doubled in 2018, which is closely related to some of the head financing projects in the first half of the year. If this part of the relevant impact is excluded, the amount of crowdsourcing financing of digital assets will decrease by 4.7% annually in 2018.
          
In March 2018, the fund-raising reached a small peak, reaching its peak in May; in the second half of the year, the amount of fund-raising in the six months was below the annual average, showing a weak state as a whole; and the trend continued until the end of 2018, reaching its lowest point in November and December.

ICOs were launched in April, May and June of 2018, and by 11/31 of 2018, a total of 2243 digital asset crowdsourcing projects were launched.       
     
Successful completion of financing projects in the first five months maintained at about 50%; from the second half of 2008, the average monthly completion of financing projects accounted for a gradual decline in the proportion of financing projects, reaching a record low at the end of November, with only 26% successful completion of financing projects. Quarterly, the four quarterly percentages are 54%, 46%, 36% and 29% (excluding December data).

Sourse: ICO Watchlist

According to ICO Watchlist data, in 2018, crowdsourcing projects of digital assets are mainly concentrated in the application field, in which the financial sector has always been the first. The top three areas were finance (12.1%), payment/wallet (6.7%) and commerce/retail (5.6%). Compared with 2017, the proportion of assets management projects dropped out of the top three, and most of these projects have securities trading attributes and will face supervision and other reasons.

## 1.3. Investor sentiment has also declined
In addition to the sharp decline in trading volume, the spirit of investors in the digital asset market has also declined sharply, as can be seen from the Google trend of hot words search, the topic of digital assets is getting less heated.

However, from an investor sentiment, the market is still looking forward to the first half of 2019. After entering 2018, the digital asset market has shown a downward trend, but the market is still full of hope for 2019.

According to Firecoin Block Chain Research Institute's monthly survey of global individual and institutional investor sentiment, the market remained optimistic for the first half of 2019 and believed it would rise slightly. Among them, 78.0% of the voters believe that the total market value of digital assets will rise in the next six months, and 28.5% of the voters are very confident in the market and believe that the market value of digital assets will rise substantially in the next six months. The increase was more than 30%.

## 2. Prospect of Digital Currency Capital Market in the future.
## 2.1. Summary and review

It has been more than ten years since the birth of Bitcoin, and the development of technology has brought about social progress. Block chain technology is considered as the infrastructure of the next generation of Internet. Common economy brings multi-dimensional measure of value. Consensus mechanism brings about changes in production relations. It brings information Internet into the value Internet and generates a number of projects with epochal significance, such as community public chain ETH. EOS, anonymous network DASH, de-centralized content platform Steemit, de-centralized cloud storage SC, super computing GNT, the achievements and significance of these community-based projects are unique and important. However, as an important part of block chain technology, digital currency brings the stigma of block chain technology: the development of ICO brings speculation, follow the trend and speculation; the result of capital influx is project fraud, investment on behalf of the road and leek cutting; the emergence of new technology brings stack block engineering, project circle money and overwhelming prices.

Technological development should be devoted to improving people's lives and improving the well-being of the world's people. This is the concern of Einstein and Oppenheimer in the last century. It is also a question that should be paid attention to and repeatedly emphasized by today's encrypted currency community: is digital money applied to terrorist financing, money laundering and even crime? Has the market bubble of encrypted money created widespread social problems, such as the widening gap between the rich and the poor? With the application of encrypted currency in a wider range of fields, how to reduce or even avoid the negative impact of its development?  
          
Discussions on these issues go beyond the technical issues themselves, but they are the places that the encryption community has to face and attach importance to. Block chain technology will be more widely used in the future than today. When people place more expectations on the development of technology, it also means that the community should take greater responsibility for the development of technology. From encrypted communities to DAOs, "consensus" needs to be built on its own behavioral constraints, and the spirit of "autonomy" should also assume responsibility for the consequences of Technological Development in line with human well-being.

## 2.2. Prospect of Digital Currency Capital Market in the future
In technology, block chain technology will be oriented to the problems that can be solved at present. With most of the main public chain networks on line, DApps will be given more diversified choices and further promote the development of industrial applications. SDK developer tools and underlying development platforms will gradually mature, including Internet giants and innovative enterprises will benefit from the improvement of infrastructure. In the field of privacy technology, with the development of encryption community and the gradual popularization of distributed network, it is expected that there will be more diversified innovations than in 2018. In addition, community discussions on consensus mechanism, protocol layer, DApps, Layer 1 and Layer 2 will continue.

In industry, block chains will take the lead in financial, game and passport assets and go farther than ever before. They are expected to be in the areas of Internet of Things, supply chain, identity solutions, data validation and BaaS. Regardless of whether these projects are autonomous or alliance, block chains will bring wider pilot and landing in 2019. To a more complex industry applications appear in various fields, whether it is "block chain +" or "block chain +" all indicate the wide landing of blocks and the gradual decline of entry threshold. Of course, there will also be a wave of integration in the industry. Under the background of the bear market in the capital market, projects with unique competitive advantages and product advantages will survive and succeed.            

In terms of policy, the development of compliance will be a short-and medium-term trend from mid-2018 to 2019, while the assets, securities and digital derivatives will be gradually integrated into the current regulatory system. Policy risks and market risks will be greatly reduced in 2019. Informal financing, including ICO, will still have some market space and will gradually move towards conformity. The DICO direction of game rules is developing, of course, STO is another topic. Although the market is a negative factor in the short run, in the long run, the promulgation of regulatory policies will promote the positive and healthy development of the sector chain.

## Conclusion
2018 is the stage of reshuffling the whole industry.We are still confident about the future of the block chain. The future is bright, but the road is always tortuous.
